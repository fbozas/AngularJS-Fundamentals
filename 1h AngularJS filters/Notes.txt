AngularJS filters
	Filters can do 3 different things
		Format, Sort and Filter data

	Filters can be used with a binding expression or a directive

	To apply a filter use pipe character (|)

	Filters for formatting data
		lowercase: Formats all characters to lowercase
		uppercase: Formats all characters to uppercase
		number: Formats a number as text, includes comma as thousands seperator and the number of
			decimal places can be specified
		currency: Formats a number as a currency. $ is default. Custom currency and decimal places can be specified
		date: Formats date to a string based on the requested format

	limitTofilter: Can be used to limit the number of rows or characters in a string
		{{expression | limitTo: limit : begin}}
	i.e
		<tr ng-repeat="employee in employees | limitTo:rowLimit:0"> 
		// 0 Shows the begining index of rows (which employee will appeared as first one)
	
	Look now the result. When you change the value of dropdown the number of results are automatically changed.
	This is the power of two way data binding
