AngularJS ng src directive
	Using a binding expression with the image src attribute, results in a 404 error

	Reason of 404 error 
		As soon as the DOM is parsed, an attempt is made is to fetch the image from the
		server. At this point, AngularJS binding expression that is specified with the 
		src attribute is not evaluated. Hence 404 (not found) error

	To fix the 404 error use the ng-src directive
		ng-src directive attribute ensures that a request is issued only after AngularJS has
		evaluated the binding expression
