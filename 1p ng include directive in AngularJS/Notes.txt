16. ng include directive in AngularJS

	ng include directive is used to embed an HTML page into another HTML page

	This technique is extremely useful when you want to reuse a specific view in multiple pages in your application

	The value for ng-include directive

		Can be the name of the HTML page that you want to reuse
			<div ng-include="EmployeeList.html"></div>

		OR
		A property on the $scope object that points to the reusable HTML page
			<div ng-include="employeeList"></div>


	Code First step

		On index.html add this code
			
			<body ng-app="myModule">
    				<div ng-controller="myController">   
        				<div ng-include="employeeView"></div>         
    				</div>
			</body>

		 Add a file named EmployeeTable.html with this code

			<table>
    				<thead>
        				<tr>
            					<th>Name</th>
            					<th>Gender</th>
            					<th>Salary</th>
        				</tr>
    				</thead>
    				<tbody>
        				<tr ng-repeat="employee in employees"> 
            					<td>{{employee.name}}</td>
            					<td>{{employee.gender}}</td>
            					<td>{{employee.salary}}</td>
        				</tr>
    				</tbody>
			</table>

		And on app.js

			var myApp = angular
                		.module('myModule', [])
                		.controller('myController', function($scope){
                    			var employees = [
                       				// employees
                    			];
                
                    		$scope.employees = employees;
                    		$scope.employeeView = "EmployeesTable.html";
                	});
